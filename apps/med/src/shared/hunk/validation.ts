/**
 * How every review boundary checks what it was handed.
 *
 * Three primitives that the prototype re-declared at roughly twenty sites, with the drift
 * that implies: byte measurement done in two units, digest patterns whose case sensitivity
 * disagreed between the writer and the reader, and an exact-key check inlined once per
 * parsed shape (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`, D1/D5). They live here, in the shared
 * model, because the producer, the wire protocol, and later a browser client must all
 * agree — and because none of them may reach for a platform encoder or a hashing runtime
 * to answer these questions.
 *
 * Hashing itself is *not* here: computing a SHA-256 needs a platform primitive, so it
 * arrives as an injected `ReviewDigestFn` from whichever tier owns bytes. Core only names
 * the algorithm, validates the shape, and compares two values.
 */

/**
 * Number of UTF-8 bytes one string encodes to.
 *
 * Computed from code units rather than through `TextEncoder`, so measurement never
 * depends on a platform global and always answers the same for the same string. Lone
 * surrogates count as the three bytes their replacement character encodes to, which is
 * what any conforming encoder would actually emit.
